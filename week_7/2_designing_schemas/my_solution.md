## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
I modeled what I would imagine a database at a vet's clinic would look like for the one to one. For the many to many schema, I modeled users' ownership of many gaming consoles.

## Release 5: Reflection
I wish we had more resources for this particular challenge because I didn't have anything to solidify the concepts that the directions explained. I'm still a bit unclear which schema is better to use in certain situations, but I suppose it'll come with experience.
