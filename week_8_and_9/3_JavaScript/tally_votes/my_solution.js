// Pseudocode
// Create a for loop that iterates through each student in votes, and then a nested loop that
// iterates through the candidates each student voted for. If the candidate exists in voteCount
// already, add 1 to the tally. Otherwise, set tally to 1.

// Create a for loop that iterates through each office in voteCount. Set a variable highest_tally
// to 0 and then nest a loop that iterates through the tallies for each candidate. If the candidate's
// votes are higher than the tally, then set the highest_tally to the vote amount and set the office in
// officers to the name of the candidate.

// Initial Solution

for (var student in votes) {

  for (var office in ballot) {

      voteCount[office][candidate] += 1;

}

// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution
// I'm not good at refactoring Javascript logic/syntax yet but I think the variable names are fine.





// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// I'm glad I did this challenge because I had no idea how to iterate through nested object properties, so 
// this whole thing was a learning experience. On line 83, I tried doing voteCount[office] == null but it 
// didn't work as I thought it would, so I found hasOwnProperty. During the whole challenge, I kept thinking
// "oh this would be so much easier if I did this in Ruby", and that reminds me of people saying that Ruby
// is an easy language to pick up. I'm beginning to realize this from my experiences with other languages
// as well.
